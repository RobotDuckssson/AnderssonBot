This small app fetches data from my solar panels and current weather.
The app Tweets information on its own Twitter account.
This app will probably by automated some time in the future.

The app uses a config file to get api keys and other private data.

For Twitter it uses the Tweepy API.
The solar panel data is fetched from my Solar Edge account via the provided API.
